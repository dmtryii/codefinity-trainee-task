## First Task:
Solve the basic task and make your code as extensible and flexible as possible.

### Basic task:
Given an integer n, return and print a string array answer for (1 .. n)
- answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
 -answer[i] == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

## Second Task:
Task - imagine that Docker does not exist, and as a developer, you need to implement Docker from scratch.
Describe, at the pseudocode or high-level algorithm level, the implementation of the feature for creating and running a container.
Also, specify the operating system API required to implement such a feature.
Do not include handling all possible exceptional situations.

Pseudofunctions should have names corresponding to existing Unix commands (tar, rm, touch),
or system call invocations (cgroups cpuset 1),
or simply describe actions on operating system entities (mount the /olddir directory into /newdir).
